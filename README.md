# Meme Generator

This provides the user a list of functions that can be used to edit images in the style of a "deep fried meme". Additionally, I provide a function that allows
the user to add text to their image. This text can be either user inputted, or randomly selected from a provided list. Enjoy!


Example:

![](/example.jpg)
